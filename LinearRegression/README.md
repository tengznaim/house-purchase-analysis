# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This is a revisit of a group assignment where we previously numerically solved for the gradient and intercept of a linear model that predicts house prices based on the number of years since 2009. Back then, we used the least square method using matrices.

Using the same data set, I decided to attempt another approach where I used gradient descent for linear regression to compute the parameters of the linear model.

After some tweaking of the learning rate and iterations, I believe to have succesfully found the parameters using this method. The parameters would have resulted in the global minimum of the cost function and match the coefficients found when numerically computed with the least square method.

Conclusion: Naim is happy with his progress in linear regression.
